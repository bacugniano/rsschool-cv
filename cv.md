Hi, my name is Vitaly and I am a novice web developer.I have small commercial experience in website development - there are two small projects. I am good at site layout, but my JavaScript level is low.  That's why I want to improve my knowledge in JavaScript, learn some framework (like React or Vue) and find a job as a Front-end developer.

## Skills ##
* HTML
* CSS
* BEM
* SCSS
* Basic JS
* English A1
